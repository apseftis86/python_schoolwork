pip install - will install whatever module you are adding to pip

pip list - will list all of your installed packages in whatever environment you are in

deactivate just deactivates your virtual environment

pip freeze - This is one that I have never seen before since I havent done a lot of work
with pip and python but it is really cool since it shows you the list of installed packages 
in the "requirements" format so when you do pip install -r requirements.txt it can install the 
modules you need.

pip freeze > requirements.txt will create a file that includes the requirements (installed packages)
for your environment.

pip uninstall - removes the package

pip show - will show information about the packages that you have listed. name, version, summary etc

pip search - whatever word you use in this one it will show you the PyPI packages that have that
name included.
