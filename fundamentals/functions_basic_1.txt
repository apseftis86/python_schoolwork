#I have a feeling during the codes where there are multiple prints and returns I have them 
#incorrect as I dont remember if the function should be printing while finding the return value of a function

#1
will return 5

#2
will return 10

#3
will return 5... I think return 10 under the return 5 will not happen since 
return should stop the function

#4
will return 5... I think print 10 under the return 5 will not happen since
return should stop the function

#5
should print 5 but not a value that is returned?
#None also came out of this probably because a() has no value

#6
will print 8?

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'NoneType'
-- Got this probably because inside of the function you are just printing the value of the adding not returning it
